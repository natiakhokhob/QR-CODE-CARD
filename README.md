## Overview
I am just a begginer. However this challange shows my new skill in HTML and CSS. I try to improve my skill everyday. 

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.




## My process
AT first I strart in HTML, and then continue in CSS. I knew some different tags and styles , however it was not enough, therefore I was looking for everything what I need, for example I improved my flexbox model, and also box-model.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox





To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
